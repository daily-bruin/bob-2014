In the Philippines, different districts or villages are called barangays, and each one has a chairman and a council who governs the goings on within the community. 

Gregorio Lantajo Jr. is the chairman or captain of the San Joaquin Barangay, which was hit hard by Typhoon Yolanda. 

The storm caused several storm surges, which brought waves of water up to 20 feet high into the San Joaquin Barangay. 

Lantajo recalls the chaos immediately following the typhoon, when the barangay was isolated from national and international aid and many people were still missing.
