Mercy in Action midwives took their operation to Dulag, about an hour outside of Tacloban City, in order to help provide health care for pregnant women and babies immediately after Typhoon Yolanda. 

Jenifer Bunquin, a midwife, recalls her surprise when a woman came in and unexpectedly delivered twins in the disaster zone.
