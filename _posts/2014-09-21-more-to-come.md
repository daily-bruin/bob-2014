After more than two weeks reporting in the Philippines, our team is back in the United States.

We’ll be working on putting together a large package of work to share our reporting and tell the stories of the many people we met. The work will follow the UCLA student donations to Typhoon Haiyan/Yolanda relief as well as the lives of people who were impacted by the storm.

The project will be published here in early October, so keep an eye out for more in the coming weeks.
