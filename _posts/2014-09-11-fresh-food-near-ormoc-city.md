The home-cooked Filipino meal was also home-grown. 

Squash, okra and a spinach-like vegetable called kangkong sprouted out of neat rows and in terraced planters.

The pigsty was nearby, but it didn’t smell and the pen of piglets was silent. 

Everything but the noodles was grown on site at the Water, Agroforestry, Nutrition and Development farm.

WAND workers wear many different hats in their humanitarian work, but in Leyte, one of their primary roles has been as a resource for locals to learn to grow their own food. 

The area around Ormoc City was hit by heavy winds and rain that damaged roofs and knocked down several homes in Typhoon Yolanda. 

The storm damaged many of the local crops and fields, as well, stripping the area of valuable resources and many livelihoods. 

But now people are finding a new livelihood growing their own vegetables.

The fresh food made a delicious lunch in the middle of our day touring WAND’s beneficiary sites all around the countryside outside of Ormoc City. 

And that’s the point of the gardens that WAND helped typhoon survivors plant all over Leyte and Samar. Once families start farming their own produce, they can stop spending their pesos at the market.

The gardens that WAND sponsored brightened up the bunk houses where Ormoc’s displaced residents are living temporarily.

With all the new vegetation popping up out of the soil, the area around Ormoc City was ripe with regrowth.
