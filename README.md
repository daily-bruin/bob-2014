This is the code for [yolanda.dailybruin.com](http://yolanda.dailybruin.com), the Daily Bruin's reporting project in the Philippines that covered Typhoon Haiyan/Yolanda recovery ten months after the storm.

The project was made possible by the [Bridget O'Brien Scholarship Foundation](http://www.rememberingbridget.com) which is in its seventh year of funding UCLA journalism with global reach and local impact.

## Installation

1. Install [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
1. Run `jekyll --serve`
1. Go to `http://localhost:4000/blog`. The `/` directory will give you a 404 error because the redirect to the first story is in `.htaccess` that the Jekyll server doesn't support.
